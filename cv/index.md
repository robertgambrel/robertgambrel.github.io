# Skills

I am a full-stack data scientist. I have extensive experience building complex SQL queries to transform raw data into the format needed for advanced analytics. I have thorough knowledge of the usual data preparation/ETL libraries and have published the R package [`medicare`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=medicare) to help others have an easier time wrangling CMS's publicly available datasets. I have deployed a variety of machine learning models into business production and prepared client-facing reports in Tableau and R Shiny. Beyond the software implementation skills, I have extensive graduate-level training in a variety of statistical methods including simulation, machine learning, hierarchical, and Bayesian modeling. I have built numerous web scrapers using Selenium to save my coworkers' time in preparing periodic reports. Beyond the publications above, publicly-available examples of my work can be found on [my GitHub page](https://www.github.com/robertgambrel).
