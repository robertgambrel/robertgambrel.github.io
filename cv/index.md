# Current Work
I am a Data Scientist for [Intermedix](https://www.intermedix.com), a Nashville-based healthcare revenue cycle management. I am on the Data Science team, and we focus on a variety of analytics projects. Using client medical records, we make a variety of predictions: whether a claim is undercoded or miscoded, whether it will be paid by an insurer, and how long it will take to pay. We also provide clients with predictions on whether scheduled patients will attend their appointments.

While our main focus is prospective analysis, we also conduct retrospective reporting on the client's coding and billing practices, looking for patterns that can lead to missed revenues. These can include identifying coders that systemically undercode, payer groups that do not pay at contractual rates, and undercollection of patient copays and deductibles.

# Prior Analytics Work
I was a Health Policy Data Analyst in the Department of Health Policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine since From March 2015 through December 2016. My work touched on a wide range of topics and included:

- Accessing Medicare claims records in a SAS Enterprise Guide system
	- Data used to track spending patterns across years and analyze the causal impact of demographic changes and treatment patterns on spending levels over time
	- Data used to analyze differences in treatment patterns of providers participating in pilot Medicare cost-savings programs
- Combining public and private records on providers of post-acute care services using R
	- Converting point-in-time data into panel datasets to allow for simpler analysis of yearly trends in sector ownership
- Using Python scripts and public data sources' APIs to automatically track employment changes in healthcare sectors

# Programming Knowledge
I was trained in Stata as a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, with some courses teaching R as well. While there, I taught myself Lyx and ultimately moved to pure Latex for all of my presentations and papers.

After starting as a Data Analyst at VUMC, I switched from Stata to R after needing the ability to work with multiple datasets simultaneously. Since learning about the [tidyverse programs](https://www.tidyverse.com), I haven\'t looked back. I have published an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/medicare/index.html) using many advanced R techniques including handling standard vs. non-standard evaluation and vectorized alrogithms. I have learned Python programming and its standard analytic packages (pandas, numpy, etc.) and have contributed to our department's internal package that automates feature engineering tasks. Across my professional experience, I have used just about all of the SQL implementations.


# Prior Experience
As a graduate student, I worked as a research assistant on multiple projects at the University of Minnesota, including survey analysis and time-series conflict forecasting. My substantive focus was on economic development, democratization, and public spending; my methodological training centered on game theory, formal models, and quantitative methods. I also worked for two years as an editorial assistant for [Comparative Political Studies](http://cps.sagepub.com/), a peer-reviewed journal in comparative politics.

Before graduate school, I worked as a client advocate at the [Tennessee Justice Center](http://www.tnjustice.org), a nonprofit law firm in Nashville, TN, specializing in advocacy for expanding health care options for underserved populations and ensuring that eligible beneficiaries receive the care to which they are entitled.
