# Current Work
I have been a Health Policy Data Analyst in the Department of Health Policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine since March 2015. My work touches on a wide range of topics and includes:

- Accessing Medicare claims records in a SAS Enterprise Guide system
	- Datasets can have 1 billion+ entries each
	- Data used to track spending patterns across years and analyze the causal impact of demographic changes and treatment patterns on spending levels over time
	- Data used to analyze differences in treatment patterns of providers participating in pilot Medicare cost-savings programs
	- I have written programs to implement a novel approach to analyzing episodes of care after inpatient treatment and determine which patients are treated by pilot program physicians
- Combining public and private records on providers of post-acute care services using R
	- Converting long-form data into wide-form dataframes using custom extraction programs
	- Converting point-in-time data into longitudinal datasets to allow for simpler analysis of yearly trends in sector ownership
	- Managing compliance survey database of multiple tables, some with 1,000,000+ rows or 1000+ variables
- Tracking monthly employment in health sector jobs and comparing employment level changes with changes in public spending on health care
	- I use Python to access Federal Reserve data through their API services
	- I analyze the data with matplotlib and statsmodels libraries
- Other general programming tasks
	- I have written Python programs to parse SAS import programs and convert them to Stata import .do files, when other analysts did not have access to SAS and there were too many import scripts to recode manually
	- I have written Python programs to automatically download large lists of csv datasets from remote repositories, saving the analyst from having to download them one-by-one manually
	
# Programming Knowledge
I was trained in Stata as a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, with some courses teaching R as well. While there, I taught myself Lyx and ultimately moved to pure Latex for all of my presentations and papers.

After starting as a Data Analyst at VUMC, I switched from Stata to R after needing the ability to work with multiple datasets simultaneously, and because its easier (to me) way of writing functions. Since learning about the hadleyverse programs (dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2), I haven\'t looked back. I learned SAS from a watching a couple of the SAS Institute\'s free tutorials and lots of googling. Similarly, my Python skills come from a few EdX and Coursera intro courses and knowing enough about errors to troubleshoot and know the right terms to search when I\'m stuck.

# Prior Experience
As a graduate student, I worked as a research assistant on multiple projects at the University of Minnesota, including survey analysis and time-series conflict forecasting. I also worked for two years as an editorial assistant for Comparative Political Studies, a peer-reviewed journal in comparative politics.

Before graduate school, I worked as a client advocate at the [Tennessee Justice Center], a nonprofit law firm in Nashville, TN, specializing in advocacy for expanding health care options for underserved populations and ensuring that eligible beneficiaries receive the care to which they are entitled.
