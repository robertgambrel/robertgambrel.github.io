title: Robert Gambrel - About
---

I am a Data Scientist at [Intermedix](https://www.intermedix.com/), a Nashville-based healthcare software and emergency preparedness company. I use SQL, R, Python, and Tableau to analyze electronic health record data and identify inappropriate coding patterns, missed revenues, and areas for improvements in billing and reimbursement practices. We use local databases and analytic servers and are expanding our AWS cloud capability for larger data sources that require Spark clusters.

I am also enrolled in Georgia Tech's Masters of Science in Analytics program, where I have completed courses including Machine Learning and Simulation. To read more about my current work and analytic skills, [please visit my CV page](/cv).

I was previously a Health Policy Data Analyst at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I used R, SAS, Python, and a little Stata to conduct numerous research projects. For several of them, we used CMS's Virtual Research Data Center, where I prepared and analyzed Medicare claims records. Some of the papers on which I was the chief data analyst include:
- [*Corporate Investors Increased Common Ownership In Hospitals And The Postacute Care And Hospice Sectors*, Health Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0591)
- [*Medicare Accountable Care Organization Enrollment and Appropriateness of Cancer Screening*](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2674256), Journal of the American Medical Association - Internal Medicine
- [*Understanding Trends in Medicare Spending, 2007â€“2014*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6773.12845), Health Services Research

I\'m originally from Omaha, and moved to Nashville to attend Vanderbilt University as an undergraduate. I majored in Public Policy and graduated in 2008. I started working for the Tennessee Justice Center, a nonprofit lawfirm in Nashville that specialized in ensuring recipients of public benefits did not face unnecessary or capricious denials or delays in services.

I then went to graduate school in Political Science at the University of Minnesota. My focus of study there was on international and comparative political economy with a supporting program from the Applied Economics department. I completed my Master\'s degree and was working on my PhD thesis when my wife was offered a great career opportunity that brought us back to Nashville. I left the PhD program and have focused on improving my programming and data science skills since then.

In my free time you can find me mowing the lawn, Netflixing modern cable dramas that everyone else saw five years ago, or pushing our daughter on her rope swing.
