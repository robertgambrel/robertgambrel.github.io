title: Robert Gambrel - About
---
I am a Health Policy Data Analyst at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. In short, I use R, SAS, Python, and a little Stata to analyze a variety of large datasets for numerous analytical projects. To read more about my current work and programming skills, [please visit my CV page](/cv).

I\'m originally from Omaha, and moved to Nashville to attend Vanderbilt University as an undergraduate. I majored in Public Policy and graduated in 2008. I started working for the Tennessee Justice Center, a nonprofit lawfirm in Nashville that specialized in ensuring recipients of public benefits did not face unnecessary or capricious denials or delays in services.

I then went to graduate school in Political Science at the University of Minnesota. My focus of study there was on international and comparative political economy with a supporting program from the Applied Economics department. I completed my Master\'s degree and was working on my PhD thesis when my wife was offered a great career opportunity that brought us back to Nashville. I left the PhD program and have focused on improving my programming and data science skills since then.

In my free time you can find me mowing the lawn, Netflixing modern cable dramas that everyone else saw five years ago, or pushing our daughter on her rope swing.
