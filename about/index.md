title: Robert Gambrel - About

## Professional Background

I am a Data Scientist at [Embold Health](https://www.emboldhealth.com), a Nashville-based healthcare startup dedicated to leveraging healthcare data to identify high-value, high-quality providers across the healthcare system. My duties include getting messy with SQL claims databases to transform raw claims files into measures of provider performance, using R and Python to analyze these results and build provider-level profiles of performance, and preparing these results for customers to interact with.

I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Masters of Science in Analytics program with a focus on Computational Data Analysis. I am on track to complete my degree in 2020.

I previously was a Data Scientist at [Intermedix](https://www.intermedix.com/). I used SQL, R, Python, and Tableau to analyze electronic health record data and identify inappropriate coding patterns, missed revenues, and areas for improvements in billing and reimbursement practices.

Prior to that, I was a Health Policy Data Analyst at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I used R, SAS, Python, and a little Stata to conduct numerous research projects. For several of them, we used CMS's Virtual Research Data Center, where I prepared and analyzed Medicare claims records.

## Personal Background
I\'m originally from Omaha, and moved to Nashville to attend Vanderbilt University as an undergraduate. I majored in Public Policy and graduated in 2008. I started working for the Tennessee Justice Center, a nonprofit law firm in Nashville that specialized in ensuring recipients of public benefits did not face unnecessary or capricious denials or delays in services.

I then went to graduate school in Political Science at the University of Minnesota. My focus of study there was on international and comparative political economy with a supporting program from the Applied Economics department. I completed my Master\'s degree and was working on my PhD thesis when my wife was offered a great career opportunity that brought us back to Nashville. I left the PhD program and have focused on improving my programming and data science skills since then.

In my free time you can find me mowing the lawn, Netflixing modern cable dramas that everyone else saw five years ago, or pushing our daughter on her rope swing.
