title: Robert Gambrel - Portfolio

I set up this website following a [tutorial by Jonathan McGlone](https:http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/), and some [GitHub guides](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/).

I have some coding examples from work and personal projects on [my GitHub page](https://www.github.com/robertgambrel).

In the future, I hope to update this page with additional examples of exhibits I've prepared at work, but those are still in the publication pipeline.
