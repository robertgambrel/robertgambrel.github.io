title: Robert Gambrel - Portfolio
---
I set up this website following a [tutorial by Jonathan McGlone](https:http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/), and some [GitHub guides](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/).

I have some coding examples from work and personal projects on [my GitHub page](https://www.github.com/robertgambrel). These include two R packages I've built to simplify my day-to-day work. The [medicare](https://www.github.com/robertgambrel/medicare) package includes wrappers and functions I've created to make manipulating publicly available Medicare datasets easier. The package has also recently been [approved by CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=medicare) and can be installed by R users via `install.packages("medicare")`. The [tabler](https://www.github.com/robertgambrel/tabler) package was written to make it quick and easy to combine regression output from multiple models into simple tables (either csv or xls). Since my workflow typically involved iterative modeling adjustments based on feedback for the rest of the team, this package made it easy to condense a variety of options in a format that others could read. I'm still testing this packages, so it's not released on CRAN just yet. Feel free to check out the readme files and vignettes for more detailed explanations of how to use them in your own work.

In the future, I hope to update this page with additional examples of exhibits I've prepared at work, but those are still in the publication pipeline.
