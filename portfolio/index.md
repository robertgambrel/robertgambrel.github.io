title: Robert Gambrel - Portfolio
---
I set up this website following a [tutorial by Jonathan McGlone](https:http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/), and some [GitHub guides](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/).

I am a contributing author on several peer-reviewed papers, which can be found at my [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Gambrel). On most of these projects I was responsible for all data preparation, modeling, and presentation.

I have published an R package called `medicare` to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=medicare). The project is also under active development on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/robertgambrel/medicare). This package includes wrappers and functions I've created to make manipulating publicly available Medicare datasets easier. I've written a [blog demonstration for the Vanderbilt Health Policy newsletter](/blog/2016/12/01/medicare-cost-report-demo) that shows how the package can be used to extract key variables from CMS Cost Reports. Future posts will show the package's functionality for handling Provider of Services reports as well. There are also [vignettes on GitHub](https://github.com/robertgambrel/medicare/tree/master/vignettes) that demonstrate the package's use.

I wrote the [tabler](https://www.github.com/robertgambrel/tabler) package to make it quick and easy to combine regression output from multiple models into simple tables (either csv or xls). Since my workflow typically involved iterative modeling adjustments based on feedback for the rest of the team, this package made it easy to condense a variety of options into a format that others could read. I'm still testing this package, so it's not released on CRAN just yet.

My [GitHub page](https://github.com/robertgambrel) also has examples of other code snippets I've used to make my life easier.

In the future, I hope to update this page with additional examples of exhibits I've prepared at work, but those are still in the publication pipeline.
