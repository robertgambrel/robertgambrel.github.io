	<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>

	<p>Thank you for visiting my site. This is still a work in progress, so please forgive any errors or broken links. I put this together to share some of my work (and as an excuse to learn GitHub's site building system).</p>
	<p>I am currently a Health Policy Data Analyst at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, doing data analysis and programming in R, SAS, Python, and Stata.</p>
	<p>Please look around, <a href="/about">learn more about me</a>, <a href = "/cv">check out my CV</a>, or <a href = "https://github.com/robertgambrel"> visit my GitHub page</a>.</p>
