	<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>

	<p>Thank you for visiting my site. This site provides some background about me, along with some demonstrations of my work. I have several years experience using electronic health record, claims, and payer data to answer research questions and provide business solutions. I conduct my work using R, Python, SQL, and Tableau, and I have used SAS in production as well.</p>
	<p>I am currently a Data Scientist on the Analytics team at Intermedix. We use a variety of analytic tools to extract insights from raw electronic health record data. We have built high-accuracy models to predict whether patients will attend their appointments, whether a payer will pay a claim in its current configuration, and whether an encounter is missing or underbilling services performed. I previously was a Health Policy Data Analyst at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, where I used R, SAS, Python, and Stata to contribute towards numerous research projects.</p>
