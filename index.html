	<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>

	<p>Thank you for visiting my site. This site provides some background about me and demonstrations of my work. I have several years' experience using electronic health records, claims, and payer data to answer research questions and provide business solutions. I primarily conduct my work using R, Python, and SQL, but I have used Tableau and SAS in production as well.</p>
	<p>I am currently a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.emboldhealth.com/">Embold Health</a>. Using healthcare claims and public data sources, we are identifying high-value, high-quality providers. I previously worked at Intermedix, where we used a variety of analytic tools to extract insights from raw electronic health record data. We built high-accuracy models to predict whether patients will attend their appointments, whether a payer will pay a claim in its current configuration, and whether an encounter is missing or underbilling services performed. Before that I was a Health Policy Data Analyst at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, where we used Medicare claims to conduct a variety of research projects.</p>
