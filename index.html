	<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>

	<p>Thank you for visiting my site. This site provides some background about me, along with some demonstrations of my work. I put it together to share some of my work (and as an excuse to learn GitHub's site building system).</p>
	<p>I am currently a Data Specialist on the Analytics team at Intermedix. We use a variety of analytic tools to extract insights from raw electronic health record data. I previously was a Health Policy Data Analyst at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, where I used R, SAS, Python, and Stata to contribute towards numerous research projects.</p>
	<p>Please look around, <a href="/about">learn more about me</a>, <a href = "/cv">check out my CV</a>, or <a href = "https://github.com/robertgambrel"> visit my GitHub page</a>.</p>
